## How to Report a Bug

To report a bug, follow these steps:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting a new bug, please check the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported. If you find an existing issue that matches yours, you can add any additional information or details that may help us understand and fix the problem.

2. **Create a New Issue**: If you couldn't find an existing issue for your problem, click on the "Report page" like and then choose the right template for your problem. Fill out the issue template with as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, and any relevant screenshots or error messages.

3. **Label and Assign**: Once you've created the issue, our team will review it and assign appropriate labels. These labels help us categorize and prioritize bugs more effectively. If everything is OK, we will attach the issue to our private project for futher investigation and fixing.
